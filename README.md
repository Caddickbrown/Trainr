**Suggested practice frequency:**
- Daily Planning Routine: Every day (obviously!)
- Email Triage: 2-3 times before starting, then as needed
- Priority Management: 3-4 times initially
- Meeting Prep: Before each significant meeting
- Data Analysis: 2-3 times to internalize the flow

## 💪 You've Got This!

These training modules are built specifically to help you leverage your ADHD strengths (hyperfocus, creativity, pattern recognition) while managing the challenges (prioritization, sustained attention, organization).

Your SIOP transformation role is a **perfect fit** for someone with ADHD who has the right systems in place. You'll bring fresh perspectives, question assumptions, and drive change in ways neurotypical colleagues might miss.
